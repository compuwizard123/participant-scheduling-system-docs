\section*{Week 9/1-9/7 Summary}
The project has been going well so far. We have chosen to explore Django as our framework for the project and have started to review it. I have run through the Django tutorial and am comfortable with it. I have worked on getting Redmine setup on our VM since we will be using it for change management and bug tracking. This will allow us to prioritize our efforts and keep track of what needs to be completed. I have been in contact with Allie and the weekly client meetings have been progressing as planned. We have been getting all of our questions answered. Finally, the milestones have been progressing well with each person getting their work completed. There is a small issue with a team member not submitting their work by the specified deadline, but hopefully that works out better for the next milestone.

\section*{Week 9/8-9/14 Summary}
Since this week was fall break there is not much to report on other than that we worked on Milestone 3 and submitted it to the PM. Working with Allie has gone smoothly and she is still providing quick responses to our queries. We feel like we have a good handle on the scope of the project and the idea is taking shape in our heads. Once again though I had to deal with a late submission for the milestone even though I was in South Dakota. I was in communication with the team via email from SD and submitted milestone 3 to the PM.

\section*{Week 9/15-9/21 Summary}
We were excited to meet with Allie on campus on Wednesday. The meeting went well and she clarified a few more points that we were unsure of. Furthermore, Allie reviewed milestones 2 and 3 in order to give us some feedback on them. We were able to incorporate some of these changes into milestone 4. I compiled milestone 4 and had again to deal with a late submission. When I filled out the peer evaluations I took this late submissions and some missing of meetings into account.

\section{Friday, October 28, 2011}

\end{itemize}

\section*{Week 9/22-9/28 Summary}
Since we met with Allie on Wednesday in person, we decided to cancel our typical Skype call with her. This allowed us to work on fixing parts of Milestone 4 and getting a head start on milestone 5. I was able to start putting information into Redmine that we will use for next quarter for development. Since we also got a good start on the usability study stuff, I was able to email Allie and get a response relating to the number of researchers she could get a hold of. We decided to meeting during the project work time, but one member decided not to show or commit his work on time. This is once again consistent with his prior behaviour and the peer evaluation. Overall, we were still able to finish milestone 4 and submit it.
