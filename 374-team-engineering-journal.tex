In the week of November 28th, we got back into the swing of working on our project. I
personally had not worked on this project before, so one of the main goals for that
week was to get me up to speed. As we completed the compilation document of Milestone
1, I reviewed what the project was and how we were expecting to implement it. We did
not have our weekly meeting with our client or project manager, but we did set times
for those meetings. After our regular meeting with Dr. Chenoweth, we had several
action items to take care of. Specifically, we needed to discuss the scope of our
project with our client to make sure we were all on the same page. We also needed to
get me ready to go with Latex, Redmine, and Git.

In this past week, we continued bringing me up to speed, and began our work on
Milestone 2. On Monday, we met with our client, Allie, and I was introduced. We also
made sure that all of us had the same understanding with regards to the scope of the
project. We were also given a feature request; Allie and her co-workers wanted to have
the ability multiple people sign up for any given time slot, up to a maximum set at
the event's creation. We replied that we would give her our answer at the next
meeting. Later in the week, we decided that the feature would be trivial to implement,
so we will be accepting the request. In our first project manager meeting, we discussed
how the quarter was going to go. We decided that, in general, we would turn our
milestones in to our PM a week before they are due, so that we have time to edit them
before turning them in. We also worked on Milestone 2 and installed Git and Latex on
my computer. For next week, we are to finish the milestone and get Redmine working for
me.

Today, we wrote our initial deployment guide for our client, Allie. The
introduction is below.
\begin{quote}
This document will provide a very good sense of how to deploy the Participant
Scheduling System, but it will not be a definite guide. Though most instructions
include concrete examples, some steps may be missing. Pay special attention
when configuring Nginx, Apache, and PostgreSQL. Furthermore, some values will
need to be changed, like the references to \verb#rose-hulman.edu#. Good luck!

Last night, we received a response from our client, Allie, regarding our
initial deployment guide. We expected her to have a server similar to our
CSSE virtual machine for our prototype. It turns out that she does not
have a full virtual machine; rather, she just has an AFS folder through
CSL (her IAIT). We have not yet decided how to proceed, but hopefully,
this will not be a huge hurdle.
