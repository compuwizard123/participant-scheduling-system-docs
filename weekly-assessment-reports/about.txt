Weekly Assessment Reports
Every Friday at noon, you should submit (as a team) a weekly status report. Status reports are to
follow the template (this will be the only template you'll be given for this class) shown below, should
be signed, and delivered in hardcopy to your instructor. These will be graded based on adherence to
the template, completeness, accuracy, and content. An updated copy of the Weekly Status Report
must be sent to the project manager 12 hours in advance of the “project manager meeting”.
The purpose of the report is to record the following in a consistent manner and place: what tasks
must be done, when they must be begun and finished, who is responsible for accomplishing them,
and where they stand with respect to their completion.
