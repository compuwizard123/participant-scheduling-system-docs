\section{Executive Summary}
This document's purpose is to detail the participant scheduling system proposed by the Human-Computer Interaction Lab of Wisconsin-Madison. It is the second document describing this project, and details project design through use cases, data flow diagrams, and storyboards.  The project exists because the lab wishes to unify their schedule information and provide a simple, intuitive interface for prospective participants to sign up for experiments.
