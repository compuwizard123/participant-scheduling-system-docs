    \begin{tabular}{|r|p{5.5cm}|p{5.5cm}|}
        \hline
        Source & Constraint & Rationale \\
        \hline
        Systems Mandate & Must be able to be ran on Red Hat Enterprise Linux Server 6.1. & This is the operating system that the client currently uses. \\
        \hline
        Technology Mandate & Must use PHP or Python as the programming languages & These are the languages supported by the client \\
        \hline
        Databases Mandate & Must use MySQL or PostgreSQL database management systems & These are the database management systems supported by the client. \\
        \hline
        Time  & The time constraint on the project is the end of Second Term (Rose Hulman time) & At this point the group is reduced to 1 person. \\
        \hline
        Equipment Budget & No new equipment can be bought for the project & The software will be place on an existing server and we have no budget. \\
        \hline
        Privacy & Participants must not be able to see who else is participating in a project. & Privacy is key for the experiments. \\
