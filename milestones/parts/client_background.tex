\section{Client Background}
The client is the \createindex{Human-Computer Interaction Lab} at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. Their research focus is the on the way humans perceive computers, and how this perception influences their actions. The main goal is to learn about this interaction through making hypotheses, experimenting, analysing the data, and then publishing papers on the results.  They draw the participants for their experiments from a wide range of people, usually ranging from 18-65 years of age and from diverse technical backgrounds.  As such, any system they use must be designed for all levels of technical competency.
