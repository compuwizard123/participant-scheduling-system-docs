\subsection{Documentation}
As part of the usability requirements, the system we provide should be intuitive enough that the end user should have no difficulties navigating the system. However, the client prefers that we provide tool-tip type documentation for the entry forms. This documentation should provide clear, concise direction for the user when entering their information. On the back-end, similar tool-tip documentation will provide the administrator with the guidance to complete their tasks such as modifying experiments or researchers. Additionally, documentation for the installation will be provided in the form of step-by-step instructions as detailed in the installation requirements section.
