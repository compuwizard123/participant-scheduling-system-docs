The \textbf{Browse Experiments} feature and \textbf{Persistent Experiment Storage} both had a Priority of Critical since they both must be implemented for even a very basic version of the scheduling System.  The effort on both was a medium as with a team of two, there would be a manageable amount of work.  \textbf{Browse Experiments} has a stability of medium since it is up for change upon the client seeing the UI.  \textbf{Persistent Experiment Storage} has a stability of high since once implemented has little chance of being changed.

\textbf{Participant Schedule Experiment} has a priority of critical since the participants must be able to sign themselves up for an experiment for the project to be successful.  Again, the effort is medium since with two people the work would be manageable.  The risk is high on this feature, since the success of the project has a dependence on the feature.  The stability would be medium since the steps are unlikely to change, but the UI could easily change.

\textbf{Levels of Authentication} is a useful priority because it would not be necessary for there to be an actual Administrator since the users trust each other, but this would be a nice feature.  The effort and stability are medium since the feature may change some, but only smaller parts of the feature, while still being a very manageable task.

\textbf{Filter Experiments} has a priority of useful, since it might only apply to users in certain situations.  \textbf{Filer Experiments} and \textbf{Experiment Participants} have a low risk, since the project does not depend on their success.  They both also have a stability of high, since changes are unlikely to happen.  The effort on \textbf{Filter Experiments} is medium, since there are some areas of the feature, such as what to filter by, that have not been established.  The  effort on \textbf{Experiment Participants} is low since a simple \gls{SQL} query will do most of the job.

\textbf{Cancel Experiment Appointment}, \textbf{Modify Experiment}, and \textbf{Add Experiment} get and effort of Medium, since most deal with \gls{SQL} and some logic on the back end.  They also have a risk of medium, since a mistake while implementing these features could create a difficult to find bug elsewhere.  The stability is medium, since parts of the database could change slightly.

\textbf{Notify Participant When Creating Appointment}, \textbf{Notify Participant Appointment Reminder}, and \textbf{Notify Participant Appointment Cancellation Reminder} all have a priority of useful since they would be nice to have, but are not vital to the projects success.  They all have an effort of medium since they involve a persons email, but could be reduced to low, depending of the framework used.  Their risk is low, since a failure here creates no problems else where in the project, nor does a mistake spread else where in the project.  The stability is high on these since they are unlikely to change.

\textbf{Export Experiment Participant List} is a useful feature, that has a high effort due to formatting of the report.  The risk is low though, since the feature is not critical in the release of the product.  Stability is high due to the feature being very specific.

An \textbf{All Experiments Calendar} would be useful for the future participants.  The effort is medium because it would be an extension of the \textbf{Browse Experiments} feature.

\textbf{Remove Experiments} has a priority of Important, since, although rare, experiments may be cancelled. The effort is low since most of it will be taken care with an \gls{SQL} query.  Also, a stability of high is given because of  how specific the feature is described.

\textbf{Accounts}, \textbf{Prevent Scheduling Confilicts for the Participant}, and \textbf{Prevent Scheduling Conflicts for the Administrator} all have a priority of useful, except for \textbf{Accounts} which Critical, since the other two features mentioned rely upon the \textbf{Accounts} along with cancellation of the experiment slots.  The effort is high for all the features due to the logic needed when implementing the features.  

\textbf{Tracking of Constent Payment Forms} and \textbf{User Report} have all been rejected, since the client does not need theses features.

\textbf{Documentation} and \textbf{Install scripts} are both useful priority.  The effort will be high, since there is complexity associated with the Install scripts and Documentation is difficult to keep up to date.  The stability would be low since the definition could change.

Items 1, 8, 15, 18, and 21 will be assigned to Kevin Risden.  Items 3, 4, 10, 11, and 12 will be assigned to Samad Jawid.  Items 6, 9,14 and 20  will be assigned to Chris Gropp.  Items 2, 5, 7, 13 and 19 will be assigned to Trey Cahill.  The entire team will work on item 22.
