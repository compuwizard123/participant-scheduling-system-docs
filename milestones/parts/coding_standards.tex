\section{Coding Standards}
Since the project will be coded in Python and use the Django framework, our team will be following the style guides for Python and Django. The style guide for Python is PEP 8 \cite{website:PEP8} and for Django it is based on PEP 8 with a few modifications \cite{website:DjangoStyleGuide}. Outlined below are a few of the main key points from both style guides.

Key Points:
\begin{itemize}
\item Use 4 spaces for indentation
\item Never mix tabs and spaces
\item Use underscores, not camelCase, for variable, function and method names
\item Use InitialCaps for class names
\item Imports should usually be on separate lines
\item Avoid extraneous white space
\end{itemize}
