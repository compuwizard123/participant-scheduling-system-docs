\section{Supportability Requirements}
While the development team will not be involved with supporting the system when handed over to the customer, the system will have some support.  The team will create documentation through out the development process. Also, the customer will recieve all code written when the system is handed over.  In order to facilitate supportability for the customer, the system will be written in Python, which the current customer is familiar with, along with the use of PostgreSQL.  With the code in a familiar language and the documentation, the customer should be able to fully support the system by themselves.
