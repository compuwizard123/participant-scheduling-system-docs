\subsection{Supportability}
While the development team will not be involved with supporting the system once it is handed over to the customer, the system will still have some support.  The team will create documentation throughout the development process. Also, the customer will receive all source code when the system is handed over.  In order to facilitate supportability for the customer, the system will be written in Python and use PostgreSQL, both with which the current customer is familiar.  With the code in a familiar language and the documentation, the customer should be able to fully support the system by themselves.
