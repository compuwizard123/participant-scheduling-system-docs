\section{Current System}
Each researcher has their own method of handling participant scheduling. For most the current system is to have the participants email the individual researcher and then that researcher records the time slot in some sort of excel spreadsheet. Other researchers have tried Google Calendar appointment slots; while this is a better system, not everyone uses it and the client believes it is too complex for most participants and some researchers.  Addressing the lack of unified data and superfluous effort on the part of the participants is the primary goal of the project.
