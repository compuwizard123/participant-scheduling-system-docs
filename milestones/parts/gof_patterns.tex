\subsection{Observer}
The class views.py is an observer pattern, as in the class it recieves a request, which then completes the request.  The views class reacts to what request it is given and then return the correct view for the page to display, with the correct information and checking for correct authorization for each request, so that a particpant cannot create an experiment.
