\section{Gang of Four Principles}
\subsection{Singleton}
To authenticate Researchers, Participants, and Administrators the system uses the Django authorization class, which has been throughly tested.  This authorization class is a use of the Gang of Four pattern Singleton.  There is only one way to access the authorization class and that is through log in of Researchers, Participants, or Administrators.  The class is not duplicated, but instead is created once, but it does get instances of itself for certain purposes.
