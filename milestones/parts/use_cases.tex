\section{Use Cases}
\subsection{General Behaviour}
Every page on the website possesses a ``login/logout/create account" button.  If the user is logged in, follow use case ``Logout".  Otherwise, follow use case ``Login".  In either case, unless noted otherwise, upon completion of that use case, the system will return to the page the button was clicked from.  If that page had user-entered fields, they will be in the same state they were when the user clicked the button.  A common exception is when a researcher or admin account logs out of a researcher or admin page, in which case they will be returned to the homepage; unauthenticated users cannot view or use researcher-only features.

Every page also possesses a button to return to the system homepage.  This will exit any use case they are currently following and discard any temporarily stored information related to that use case, such as entered fields or selected options.

Whenever a table is displayed, there is some concern related to its size; however, due to the low expected number of experiments and participants per experiment, any handling of large tables will be outsourced to the browser (scroll bars being most common).  Because the whole table will be loaded at once, browser search functionality is also sufficient to handle most searching needs; tables that can be otherwise sorted, filtered, or searched will be specifically noted.

\subsection{Authentication Use Cases}
\begin{outline}[enumerate]
\1 {\bf Name: Login}
\2 Brief Description: User logs in.
\2 Actors: User
\2 Basic Flow:
\3 User clicks the ``login/logout/create account" button from any page.
\3 User prompted for Email and Password via text boxes.
\3 The system sends their login information to the database. [A2] [A3] [A4]
\3 System displays a message confirming successful login.  The user is now logged in.
\3 After 10 seconds or when the user clicks a link to do so immediately, the user is navigated out of the login use case as specified in General Behavior.
\2 Alternate Flows:
\3 [A1] User navigates elsewhere on the website, through their browser or the ``home" button.  Unless the page they attempt to visit requires authentication, this simply drops them out of the use case.
\3 [A2] User entered an email that the database did not recognize.  Run use case ``Account Creation".
\3 [A3] User entered an email recognized by the database but not the password associated with it.  Return to email/password entry, displaying the message ``Incorrect password, please retry."
\3 [A4] System fails to connect to database.  Display the message ``Database unavailable; we are sorry for the inconvenience.  Please try again later."  Then return the user to the page they entered the use case from.
