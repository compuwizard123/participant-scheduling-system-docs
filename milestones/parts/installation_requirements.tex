\subsection{Installation}
Since our client is technically proficient, they prefer either step-by-step installation instructions or an install script. Installation instructions are typically more robust than an install script so we will be providing installation instructions with our solution. The installation instructions must be detailed enough that our client can install the web application on the machine provided by them. We have replicated to the best of our abilities the platform on which the web application will be deployed to be able to provide proper installation instructions.
