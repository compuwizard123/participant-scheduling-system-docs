It is the fifth document describing this project, and contains interface designs constructed from the use cases of Milestone 2,the results of usability analysis on that interface, and planned changes based on this analysis. The project exists because the lab wishes to unify their schedule information and provide a simple, intuitive interface for prospective participants to sign up for experiments.
